## REAL-TIME COLLABORATIVE DOCUMENT EDITOR

**Description**
## Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor

The **Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor** is a full-stack web application that enables multiple users to collaboratively create, edit, and share documents simultaneously. This project aims to replicate the core features of tools like Google Docs, offering a seamless editing experience where users can view real-time changes made by others. It’s especially useful for teams, students, content creators, and remote workers who need to co-edit documents without the hassle of sending files back and forth.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js)** along with **Socket.IO** for real-time communication.

* **Frontend**:
  Built using **React.js**, the user interface is responsive and component-based. A rich text editor is implemented using [Quill.js](https://quilljs.com/), allowing users to format text, add headings, bullet points, and other document elements.

* **Backend**:
  The server is developed using **Node.js** with **Express.js** to handle RESTful APIs. **Socket.IO** is integrated to establish a WebSocket connection for real-time updates across multiple clients.

* **Database**:
  **MongoDB** is used as the database to store documents. Each document is saved with a unique identifier, and its content is auto-saved periodically as users type.

* **Real-Time Communication**:
  **Socket.IO** facilitates bi-directional communication between the server and all connected clients. It ensures that whenever a user makes an edit, those changes are instantly reflected on all other clients editing the same document.

## Features Implemented

* Real-time collaborative editing using WebSockets
* Rich text editing using Quill
* Document creation and sharing via unique URL
* Auto-saving to MongoDB
* Clean and minimal user interface

## How It Works

1. A user opens the editor and is assigned a document ID.
2. If another user opens the same document ID, both can see and edit the same content.
3. Every keystroke is captured and broadcast to all users via Socket.IO.
4. The document content is periodically saved to the database for persistence.

### Applications

This tool can be effectively used in:

* **Team collaborations** for writing proposals, reports, and documentation
* **Educational institutions** for group assignments and shared notes
* **Startups and remote teams** for synchronous documentation
* **Technical writing** and blogging teams who need shared content editing

### Future Enhancements

* User authentication and access control
* Document history and versioning
* Role-based permissions (e.g., viewer/editor)
* Export to PDF or DOCX
* Real-time cursor tracking for collaborative visibility
